Galaga-Inspired Game Project
This project is a Python implementation of a Galaga-inspired arcade game, developed using Pygame. The game challenges players to control a spaceship, dodge enemy waves, and shoot projectiles to earn points. It highlights foundational programming concepts in game development, including sprite management, event handling, and collision detection.

Features
Player Controls:
Navigate the spaceship up and down using W and S keys.
Fire projectiles at enemies using the Space bar.
Enemy Waves:
A grid of enemy ships moves dynamically, creating challenging patterns.
Projectile Mechanics:
Projectiles are fired from the spaceship and interact with enemy ships.
Successful hits eliminate enemies and increase the player's score.
Score Tracking:
Players can see their score in real-time as they destroy enemies.
Collision Detection:
Projectiles collide with enemies, triggering visual and sound effects.
Audio Effects:
Background music and sound effects enhance gameplay immersion.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Game Library: Pygame
Assets:
Spaceship and enemy sprites.
